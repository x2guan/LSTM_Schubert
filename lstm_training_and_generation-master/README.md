#### LSTM tutorial from ml5.js (with some adjustments): https://github.com/ml5js/training-lstm

Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, RNN) for character-level language models in Python using Tensorflow and modified to work with [tensorflow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) and [ml5js](https://ml5js.org/)

Based on [char-rnn-tensorflow](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow).
