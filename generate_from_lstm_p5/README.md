Press any key to generate some text characters and add them to the array. When you have generated as much as you want, press enter to save a "notes.txt" file which you can use in create_midi if you've generated notes. This downloads the file to your default downloads folder. You should place notes.txt into the 'output' folder in 'create_midi' to use the create_midi.py script.
